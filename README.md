# What is MOMEL?

Mauricio's Obvious Minimal Expandable Language.

It is a human friendly language for writing configuration files.
Inspired by TOML, with a more conscise, minimal feature set that allows for
simple domain-specific semantics without modifying the language's syntax.

It avoids redundancy and ambiguity, so there's always an obvious way to write data,
and the meaning is always clear as day.

# Features

MOMEL has everything you truly need for configuration and nothing more:
- `# Comments`
- Name-value pairs
- Numbers (Integer and Floating point)
- Strings (normal and raw)
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Keywords (identifiers for keywords, referencing external variables, type notations, or any custom use-case)
- Adding values to existing dictionaries
- Binary, octal and hexadecimal numbers
- Scientific notation
- SI and Custom units
- Multiline, indented strings

# Example

This is an example of a record about users:
